##### app.triggerIntent is an alias for this function

## Use case

You can call a journey directly without any prompt to user with the help
of invokeJourney.

function of another journey* or a *journey itself has to be reinvoked*
after completing it’s whole flow. In such cases, this invokeJourney can
be useful.

    app.invokeJourney('journeyName', {entityName: 'entityValue'} , {'stepName': value}).then(() => {
        resolve();
     }).catch((e) => {
        //handle error
     })

    // This will trigger default intent
    app.invokeJourney('intentName')
